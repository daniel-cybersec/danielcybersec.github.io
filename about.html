            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Daniel CyberSec. I am an uprising Blue 
            team cybersecurity
            analyst with a strong interest in defending systems,
        monitoring
            networking activity, and responding to security 
        incidents
            </p>

            <h2>My Focus</h2>
            <p>
                I focus on understanding how attacks happen so that 
            I can 
                detect ,analyze, and prevent them. My learning 
            journey includes 
                hands-on labs involving log analysis, network traffic 
            monitoring,
                and basic incident response techniques.
            </p>
            <h3>My Goal</h3>
            <p>
                My goal is to grow into a skilled SOC analyst who can 
            contribute
                to protecting organizational systems, data, and users 
            through
                proactive monitoring and effective response.
